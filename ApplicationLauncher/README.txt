IMPORTANT NOTES:
-If xou override the existing files with a new version, it is recomended to start and close the program once for it t load all savefiles and save them in the new format if it has changed and delete all old files manually after that. 
Otherwise you might just delete all existing files before running the program.
- If the program crashes on launch or does not show items that should be there, then the reason should be the existing save files.


Have Fun :)
