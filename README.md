# ApplicationLauncher

This is a simple applauncher where you are able to register applications (.exe), mark them as favorite to show them on the always-om-top, hidable favorite window and set custom images for each registered executable.

Everything you need can be found in your taskbar, just right-click the launcher's icon and set everything up as you want.

**Important Notes:**

If you override the existing files with a new version, it is recomended to start and close the program once for it t load all savefiles and save them in the new format, if it has changed, and delete all old files manually after that. 
Otherwise you might just delete all existing files before running the program.

If the program crashes on launch or does not show items that should be there, then the reason should be the existing save files.

This launcher works currently only on windows plattforms, linux and mac versions might come in the future.
