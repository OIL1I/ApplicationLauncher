# ApplicationLauncher

This is a simple applauncher where you are able to register applications (.exe), mark them as favorite to show them on the always-om-top, hidable favorite window and set custom images for each registered executable.

Everything you need can be found in your taskbar, just right-click the launcher's icon and set everything up as you want.

More information can be found [here](https://github.com/OIL1I/ApplicationLauncher/wiki).

***

**Important Notes:**

The favorite window will currently show up somewhere in the top-right corner of your screen and is _NOT_ movable nor resizeable.

This launcher works currently only on windows plattforms, linux and mac versions might come in the future.
